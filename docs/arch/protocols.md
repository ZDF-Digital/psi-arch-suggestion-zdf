## Discussion on authenticity-checks
To check machine 2 machine authentication in between the systems one could use different methods although authentication and authorization will be OAuth2.0-based in any case. We only discuss different consumer authentication-methods:

* OpenID-Trust only
* DNS-Methods (like publickey authentication as dns-txt-entry, added to a whitelist, or globally allow anyone)
* at_proto (bsky also describes it as a dns-based-effort)
* ActivityPub

### OpenID-Trust only
Only manually trusted (authenticated) systems are allowed. ConsumerID and ConsumerSecret is generated by the Producer-OpenID-Service. Should be the most secure among the methods, as it only allows specified consumers into the system.

### DNS-Methods
Provide a public key that may also be signed by each consumer of the system (web-of-trust-approach).
Alternatively have a central authority.

### at_proto
Developed by bluesky / twitter as federated authentication and transmission protocol - not production-proof yet. Uses DIDs to authenticate domains.  
We strongly recommend to use did:web over did:plc, as it is at least approved bei W3C. Very similar to JWT but implemented as published txt-dns-records. Uses very strong encryption based on elliptic curves to sign and encrypt requests. Another advantage is the built-in support for message-queues.
App section of the protocol seems to be pretty flexible and also comparable to JWT.

ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol that plays a crucial role in the development of open and free discussion platforms like the Public Spaces Incubator (PSI) project. Here's a detailed description of ActivityPub and its benefits for building social media plugins in the context of PSI:

## ActivityPub Protocol

ActivityPub is an open, decentralized social networking protocol standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2018. It provides a client-to-server API for creating, updating, and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server protocol for delivering notifications and content across different servers.

The protocol is based on the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format and uses JSON-LD for structuring data. ActivityPub's main components include:

1. **Actors**: Represent users, groups, or applications.
2. **Objects**: Content items like posts, images, or videos.
3. **Activities**: Actions performed on objects, such as creating or liking a post.
4. **Inbox**: Where actors receive activities from others.
5. **Outbox**: Where actors publish their activities.

### Benefits for PSI Project

Implementing ActivityPub in the PSI project offers several advantages for building social media plugins:

1. **Interoperability**: ActivityPub allows different platforms to communicate seamlessly, enabling users on one platform to interact with users on another. This aligns with PSI's goal of creating open discussion platforms across multiple public broadcasters.

2. **Decentralization**: The protocol supports a federated network structure, reducing reliance on centralized platforms and giving users more control over their data.

3. **Customization**: PSI can tailor the implementation to suit specific needs while maintaining compatibility with other ActivityPub-enabled platforms.

4. **Open Standards**: Using an open protocol ensures transparency and allows for community contributions and improvements.

5. **Cross-platform Engagement**: Users can follow and interact with content across different PSI-affiliated platforms, fostering a broader, more diverse discourse.


### Drawbacks:
Based on the search results and the context of the PSI project, here are some potential drawbacks of using ActivityPub for building social media plugins:

1. Lack of full protocol specification: ActivityPub is not a complete social network federation protocol, but rather a transport protocol for transferring data between servers and clients. This may require additional development work to implement full social networking functionality.

2. Ambiguity and extensibility issues: The ActivityPub specification has been criticized for having too much "wiggle room" and allowing extensive customization, which can lead to interoperability problems between different implementations.

3. Scalability concerns: Some critics have raised concerns about the scalability of ActivityPub implementations, particularly in handling large numbers of users and high volumes of activity.

4. Potential for unintentional DDoS attacks: Poorly optimized ActivityPub implementations can cause accidental distributed denial-of-service attacks on other servers due to the decentralized nature of the network.

5. Limited account migration support: ActivityPub has been criticized for not natively supporting full account migration between servers, which could be a limitation for users wanting to switch platforms.

For the PSI project, these drawbacks could potentially impact the development process, user experience, and long-term scalability of the social media plugins. However, it's worth noting that ActivityPub is widely adopted and has a large ecosystem, which could provide benefits in terms of interoperability and existing implementations to build upon.


By leveraging ActivityPub, the PSI project can create a network of interconnected discussion platforms that promote open, respectful, and diverse public discourse across multiple public broadcasters. This aligns with the project's goal of developing innovative solutions for accessible and meaningful online conversations on issues of public interest, free from harassment or bullying.

The collaboration between ZDF, CBC/Radio-Canada, RTBF, and other partners in the PSI project can benefit greatly from ActivityPub's ability to foster a decentralized, yet interconnected ecosystem of public spaces for democratic dialogue.

## IDSA
Based on the provided search results, here's a description of IDSA focused on potential drawbacks and benefits for the PSI project:

### Benefits of IDSA for PSI

1. Data Sovereignty: IDSA emphasizes data sovereignty, allowing data providers to maintain control over their data and its usage conditions. This aligns well with PSI's goal of developing open and free discussion platforms.

2. Trust and Security: IDSA provides a framework for secure and trusted data sharing, which could help PSI ensure the integrity and confidentiality of user data and discussions.

3. Interoperability: IDSA aims to create standards for data spaces, potentially allowing PSI to integrate with other platforms and services more easily.

4. Decentralization: IDSA promotes a decentralized approach, which could support PSI's aim for distributed and open discussion platforms.

5. Standardization: IDSA's efforts to establish industry standards could provide PSI with a robust framework for data management and sharing.

6. Cross-platform Engagement: IDSA's focus on data spaces could enable PSI to facilitate discussions across different platforms and organizations more seamlessly.

### Potential Drawbacks of IDSA for PSI

1. Complexity: Implementing IDSA standards and architecture may introduce additional complexity to the PSI project, potentially requiring more resources and expertise.

2. Limited Social Media Focus: Unlike ActivityPub, IDSA is not specifically designed for social networking, which may require additional work to adapt it for PSI's discussion platform needs.

3. Implementation Challenges: The comprehensive nature of IDSA's framework might pose challenges in terms of integration with existing PSI systems or rapid prototyping.

4. Potential Overhead: The governance model and certification processes of IDSA could introduce administrative overhead for PSI.

5. Ecosystem Dependency: Adopting IDSA might tie PSI more closely to a specific ecosystem of technologies and standards, potentially limiting flexibility in some areas.

6. Learning Curve: The IDSA approach may require significant learning and adaptation for the PSI team, especially if they are more familiar with social media-specific protocols.

In conclusion, while IDSA offers strong benefits in terms of data sovereignty, trust, and interoperability, it may present challenges in terms of complexity and social media-specific functionality for the PSI project. The decision to use IDSA would depend on PSI's specific requirements, especially regarding data governance and integration with broader data ecosystems beyond social media.
